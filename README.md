# MagicMirror
Final project for MAS.S65. Magic mirror is meant to be shown on a screen behind a half-silvered mirror for a mirrored effect.
This mirror is inspired by the magic mirror in Dreamworks film Shrek, however most all faces work with the software in this github. 

This project is a branch off of work done by Kyle McDonald with his ofxFaceTracker and arturo and his FaceSubstitution library based off of ofxFaceTracker.

To start this project, download both ofxFaceTracker and ofxCv as explained in the readme for ofxFaceTracker. 
https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker

Since this project includes an extension upon FaceSubstitution there is no need to pull the extra repository. However pulling it for experimentation of your own is highly suggested!
